# 15. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What languages does LegalEase support?**

A: Currently, LegalEase works best with English documents. Multi-language support is planned for future updates.

**Q: Why can't I scan T&C automatically on iOS?**

A: Apple's privacy restrictions prevent apps from reading screen content globally. iOS users can use the Share Sheet, Safari Extension, or Custom Keyboard instead.

**Q: How do I export an analysis report?**

A: When viewing an analysis, tap the Share/Export button. Premium users can export as formatted PDF. Free users can share as text.

## Premium Questions

**Q: Is there a free trial?**

A: Yes! New users get a 7-day free trial of Premium when they first subscribe. Cancel anytime during the trial and you won't be charged.

- Web: Contact support@legalease.app within 14 days

## Technical Questions

**Q: Why does the Android T&C scanner need accessibility permission?**

A: The accessibility service allows LegalEase to read text on your screen to detect and analyze Terms & Conditions. We only scan for T&C-related content and never read personal information.

**Q: Does the T&C scanner drain my battery?**

A: The scanner is optimized for minimal battery impact. If you notice significant drain, enable "Battery Saver Mode" in T&C Scanner settings.

**Q: Can I use LegalEase in my country?**

A: LegalEase is available worldwide. However, the AI is trained primarily on US and UK legal documents. Analysis of documents from other jurisdictions may be less accurate.
